// Stack Register
/*
A stack is a list of values that grows and shrinks dynamically. A stack may be
implemented as an Array that uses two Array methods: Array.prototype.push and
Array.prototype.pop.

A stack-and-register programming language is a language that uses a stack of
values. Each operation in the language operates on a register, which can be
thought of as the current value. The register is not part of the stack. An
operation that requires two values pops the topmost item from the stack (i.e.,
the operation removes the most recently pushed value from the stack), operates
on the popped value and the register value, and stores the result back in the
register.

Consider a MULT operation in a stack-and-register language. It removes the value
from the stack, multiplies the removed stack value with the register value, then
stores the result back in the register. For example, if we start with a stack of
[3, 6, 4] (where 4 is the topmost item in the stack) and a register value of 7,
the MULT operation mutates the stack to [3, 6] (the 4 is removed), and the
result of the multiplication, 28, is left in the register. If we do another MULT
at this point, the stack is mutated to [3], and the register is left with the
value 168.

Write a function that implements a miniature stack-and-register-based
programming language that has the following commands (also called operations or
tokens):

- n : Place a value, n, in the register. Do not modify the stack.
- PUSH : Push the register value onto the stack. Leave the value in the
  register.
- ADD : Pop a value from the stack and add it to the register value, storing the
  result in the register.
- SUB : Pop a value from the stack and subtract it from the register value,
  storing the result in the register.
- MULT : Pop a value from the stack and multiply it by the register value,
  storing the result in the register.
- DIV : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped
  stack value, storing the integer result back in the register.
- REMAINDER : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the
  popped stack value, storing the integer remainder of the division back in the
  register.
- POP : Remove the topmost item from the stack and place it in the register.
- PRINT : Print the register value.

All operations are integer operations (which is only important with DIV and REMAINDER).

Programs will be supplied to your language function via a string argument. Your
function may assume that all arguments are valid programs â€” i.e., they will not
do anything like trying to pop a non-existent value from the stack, and they
will not contain any unknown tokens.

Initialize the stack and register to the values [] and 0, respectively.

P:

We want to create a function that mimics a stack-and-register programming
language. The function will accept a string as an argument. The string will
represent the list of commands to perform on either the stack or register. We
should initialize the stack to an empty array, and the register to 0.

Rules:
1. `n` represents a number, and this number should be placed in the register.
2. PUSH pushes the value of the register onto the stack, and leaves the value in
   the register.
3. ADD pops a value from the stack and adds it to the value in the register,
   replacing the current value with the sum.
4. SUB pops a value from the stack and subtracts from the value in the register,
   and replaces the value with the delta.
5. MULT pops a value from the stack and multiples it with the value in the
   register, replacing the value with the product.
6. DIV pops a value from the stack and divides with the value in the register,
   and replaces the value with the quotient.
7. REMAINDER pops a value from the stack and finds the remainder of dividing the
   register value with the stack value, and replaces it with the remainder.
8. POP removes the top most value of the stack and places it in the register.
9. PRINT prints the current value of the register

Algorithm:

Initialize `stack` to an empty collection
Initialize `register` to `0`

Split the given string into individual words

Iterate over the collection of commands
- Perform the necessary command based on the given information above
