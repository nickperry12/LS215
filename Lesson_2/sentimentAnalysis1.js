// Sentiment Analysis 1

/*
Implement a function that takes some text as an argument and logs some
information about whether the text has a positive, negative, or neutral
sentiment.

P:

We want to implement a function that accepts a string as an argument. The
function should parse through the string, and counter the amount of words that
have a positive and negative connotation, and then find the difference between
the two. If the difference is a positive number, the overall connotation is
positive, if it's negative, the overall connotation is negative, and if it's
zero, the connotation of the string is neutral. The positive and negative words
should be stored within separate collections to be use in the function output. A
message should be logged to the console stating the results of the analysis in
the following format:

There are `num` positive words in the text. Positive sentiments: fortune, dream,
respect, love, resolution

There are `num` negative words in the text. Negative sentiments: die, heartache,
die, death, weary, death

The sentiment of the text is `connotation result`

-- Modeling/Algorithm:

Extract all positive words
- Iterate through the collection of positive words, and find all matches within
  the given text
  - If there is a match for a word
    - Create a key value pair, where the key is the word and the value is the
      amount of times that word appears
    - Store the key value pairs in an object
- Return the object

Extract all negative words
- Iterate through the collection of negative words, and find all matches within
  the given text
    - If there is a match for a word
    - Create a key value pair, where the key is the word and the value is the
      amount of times that word appears
    - Store the key value pairs in an object
- Return the object

Analyze the given text
- Find all positive words, store in object
  - Sum all of the values in the object to find the total number of positive
    words
  - Use the list keys to find all positive words from the text
- Find all negative words
  - Sum all of the values in the object to find the total number of negative
    words
  - Use the list keys to find all negative words from the text

Find the difference between the total positive words and the total negative
words
- The result should be `'positive'` if the difference is positive, `'negative'`
  if it's negative, and `'neutral'` if it's neutral

Return the results in the required message format
